# GaminConnect - Selenium

#### This program scrapes today's scale data from a Garmin Connect account and writes it to an Excel table
#### I started this project during my Men's Physique Competition prep so I could track my weight lost progress.

## Dependencies
- Selenium
- Chrome Driver
- openpyxl

## Goals
- Access Garmin Connect account using Selenium
- Scrape scale weigh in data
- Add scale data into excel table

## Future Considerations
- Populate all missing data instead of just today's date. (incase porgram is not run every day)
- Store data in a SQL table
- Error handling (ex. if there is no scale data for a given day.)
