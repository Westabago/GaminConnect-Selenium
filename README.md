# GaminConnect-Selenium
Here I use Selenium to scrape data from my Gamin Connect account and update an Excel file which is used for analysis.

Before this program, I would open my Garmin Connect app and copy over the values into a spreadsheet everyday.
I will be scheduling this program to run daily from my raspberry pi using Cron.

**Note 
Garmin has an API to get data from Garmin connect. This information is given out to requesters. I decided to build my own solution using selenium instead!
